# Exercise 3.1 – Understand Trends from a Table

**Objective:**  
Use AI to read and interpret tabular data, identify patterns or anomalies, and summarize findings — useful for Finance, Procurement, HR, and Sales.

---

## 🧠 Background

Spreadsheets often contain too much data to interpret quickly. AI can:
- Detect trends (growth, drops, consistency)
- Summarize in natural language
- Suggest follow-up actions

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`monthly_sales_table.csv`](assets/monthly_sales_table.csv).
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Based on this table, what trends do you notice? Are there any anomalies or drops? Summarize key insights."**

3. Then try:
   - “Suggest 3 possible reasons for the drop in May”
   - “Write a summary paragraph for the Sales Manager”
   - “Highlight which product line had the most stable growth”

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- Your AI summary in bullet or paragraph form
- 2 follow-up insights or recommendations
- Prompts used

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask:
> “Create a 3-slide summary presentation for management based on this table.”

Optionally, ask the AI to suggest a chart (bar, line, pie) to visualize the data.

---

## 💡 Tips

Prompt ideas:
- “Summarize trends in plain English”
- “Find high/low performers”
