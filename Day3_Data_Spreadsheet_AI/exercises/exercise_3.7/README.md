# Exercise 3.7

# Exercise 3.7 – Query a Table in Plain English

**Objective:**  
Use AI to interpret plain-language queries and retrieve information from structured tables — useful in finance, HR, procurement, logistics, and admin.

---

## 🧠 Background

When working with spreadsheets, you may not know exactly what formula or filter to use. AI can help you:
- Answer questions like “Who earned the most?”
- Generate summaries
- Suggest queries for dashboards or pivot tables

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`payroll_data.csv`](../exercise_3.6/assets/payroll_data.csv).
2. Ask the AI a series of plain-language queries like:

   > **"Which employees earned over 9,000 ERN gross in January?"**  
   > **"List employees with more than 1 absence and less than 8,000 net salary."**  
   > **"Who earned the highest net salary and what was their title?"**

3. Use AI to define:
   - What columns to calculate (e.g. Net Salary)
   - How to apply filters (e.g. absences, thresholds)
   - What format to use (list, table, chart, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- 3–5 queries and the AI's responses
- Your Net Salary formula used
- Any visual/table formatting applied by AI

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask:
> “Build a mini leaderboard showing the top 5 employees by net salary.”

Then ask AI:
> “Generate a chart I can paste into Excel or PowerPoint.”

---

## 💡 Tips

Use queries like:
- “Who has the most absences?”
- “Give me a summary grouped by job title”
- “What’s the average net salary for safety staff?”
