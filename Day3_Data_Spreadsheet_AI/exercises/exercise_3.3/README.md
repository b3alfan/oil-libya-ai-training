# Exercise 3.3 – Summarize Financial Tables Using AI

**Objective:**  
Use AI to read structured financial tables and generate summaries that highlight performance, growth, and areas of concern.

---

## 🧠 Background

AI can analyze structured data and:
- Summarize totals and averages
- Detect increases or decreases
- Flag unusual changes
- Suggest focus areas for finance, sales, or operations

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the Excel file `sales_and_costs.xlsx`.
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Summarize the financial performance of each product based on the revenue and cost sheets. Highlight profit trends, best/worst performing products, and any anomalies."**

3. Then try additional prompts:
   - “Which product had the highest average monthly profit?”
   - “Which month had the tightest margin across all products?”
   - “Write a short email briefing to the Finance & Admin Manager based on this data.”
