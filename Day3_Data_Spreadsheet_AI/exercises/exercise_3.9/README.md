# Exercise 3.9 – Take-Home Challenge: Build a Spreadsheet Assistant with AI

**Objective:**  
Use everything you've learned about Excel + AI to build a smart, reusable workflow that helps you automate a real spreadsheet task from your job.

---

## 🧠 Background

Spreadsheets are everywhere — payroll, inventory, sales, budgeting, task tracking, HR logs. Many tasks involve:
- Repeating calculations
- Detecting issues
- Writing summaries
- Visualizing trends

This challenge is about making AI your **Excel assistant**.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Pick a real spreadsheet or create a mock one that reflects your work (e.g., payroll, order tracking, monthly sales).
2. Use AI to help you do all of the following:
   - Write formulas to calculate something useful
   - Create at least 1 summary or report (text or bullet)
   - Suggest a useful chart (bar, line, pie, etc.)
   - Detect anomalies, trends, or red flags

3. You may re-use any of the sample datasets from Days 1–3 (sales, procurement, payroll, inventory).

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit a short report or presentation (PDF, Word, Excel) with:
- Screenshot or copy of your spreadsheet
- 3–5 AI prompts you used
- 2–3 examples of outputs (formulas, summaries, visual insights)
- A paragraph: **“How could this AI workflow save you time monthly?”**

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask AI to:
> “Convert this Excel report into a one-paragraph briefing I can email to my supervisor.”

Or:
> “Summarize this data for a weekly operations stand-up.”

---

## 💡 Tips

Prompt examples:
- “Write a formula to calculate total bonus = 10% of net salary if absences = 0”
- “Create a chart comparing diesel and gasoline sales”
- “Summarize the last 3 months in 5 bullet points”
