## 🧠 Background

You don’t have to memorize Excel formulas. You can describe what you want in plain English and let AI write the formula for you.

AI can help you:
- Calculate totals and averages
- Write IF/ELSE logic
- Apply conditional formatting
- Count filtered values

1. Open the file [`sales_and_costs.xlsx`](assets/sales_and_costs.xlsx).
2. Pick any of the following questions and **ask AI to write the correct Excel formula**:
   - What is the total yearly revenue for each product?
   - What is the profit margin (Revenue - Cost) ÷ Revenue per month?
   - Which month had the lowest diesel margin?
   - How many months did LPG sales exceed 120,000 ERN?
   - What is the average monthly cost of lubricants?

3. Copy the formulas into your spreadsheet and test the results.
