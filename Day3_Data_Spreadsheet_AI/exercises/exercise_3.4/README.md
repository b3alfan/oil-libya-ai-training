# Exercise 3.4 – Generate Procurement Summary Reports

**Objective:**  
Use AI to generate a clear summary report based on procurement records — useful for supply chain, admin, finance, and management teams.

---

## 🧠 Background

Procurement teams often work with raw order logs, supplier details, and delivery status sheets. AI can help:
- Summarize vendor performance
- Highlight delayed or incomplete orders
- Generate readable summaries for meetings or reporting

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`procurement_orders.csv`](assets/procurement_orders.csv).
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Summarize these procurement orders by supplier. Indicate total order value, delays, and any missing delivery info."**

3. Then try:
   - “Which supplier had the most delays?”
   - “What’s the total ERN value of completed orders?”
   - “Draft a procurement update memo for the Operations Manager”

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- A summary report by supplier
- 1 short AI-generated memo or briefing paragraph
- 2–3 prompts you used

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask AI:
> “Which 2 suppliers should be prioritized for review based on performance?”

Have it justify the suggestion.

---

## 💡 Tips

Prompt examples:
- “Summarize by column: supplier, status, date”
- “Highlight any red flags”
- “Format as report, not table”
