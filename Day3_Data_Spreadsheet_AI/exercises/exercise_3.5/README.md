# Exercise 3.5 – Compare Two Datasets

**Objective:**  
Use AI to compare two related datasets and generate a summary of what changed, improved, or needs attention — useful for inventory, finance, logistics, and compliance.

---

## 🧠 Background

In business, you often have to compare:
- This month vs last month
- Budget vs actual
- Planned vs delivered

AI can help you:
- Detect increases or drops
- Flag mismatches
- Summarize deltas in natural language

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`stock_levels_jan_feb.csv`](assets/stock_levels_jan_feb.csv).
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Compare the stock levels for January and February. Which products increased, which decreased, and which stayed the same?"**

3. Then prompt:
   - “Summarize key changes in bullet points”
   - “Create a short inventory update report for the depot manager”

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- A list of changes per product (increase/decrease/stable)
- A summary paragraph or report
- The prompt(s) you used and any refinements

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask:
> “Which products should be reordered based on low February stock?”

Have the AI suggest a reorder plan or threshold.

---

## 💡 Tips

Use phrasing like:
- “Compare these two columns”
- “Find differences across rows”
- “Create a human-readable summary of what changed”

---

## 📁 Assets

- [`stock_levels_jan_feb.csv`](assets/stock_levels_jan_feb.csv) — Stock levels per product for two consecutive months
