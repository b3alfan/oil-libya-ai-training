# Exercise 8.7

# ⚙️ Engineering Capstone — Predictive Maintenance Assistant

## 🎯 Goal
Use an AI assistant to analyze equipment maintenance records and operational logs in order to:
- **Predict which equipment is most likely to fail soon**
- **Identify recurring maintenance issues** (oil leaks, vibration, overheating, etc.)
- **Recommend which equipment should be upgraded or replaced**
- **Prepare a presentation** with findings and suggested engineering actions

This mirrors how Engineering & Maintenance teams at OilLibya can leverage AI to optimize equipment reliability and reduce downtime.

---

## 📂 What’s Included
- `engineering_maintenance_records.csv` → 350-line dataset of maintenance incidents, issues, and corrective actions  
- `engineering_equipment_logs.csv` → 350-line dataset of operational data (runtime, temperature, pressure, vibration)

---

## 📝 Exercise Steps (45–60 min)
1. Open the files: **`engineering_maintenance_records.csv`** and **`engineering_equipment_logs.csv`**
2. Paste a sample of the data (or the full logs in manageable batches) into your AI tool
3. Ask the AI to:
   - Group maintenance incidents by **equipment** and **issue type**
   - Identify **equipment at high risk** (frequent oil leaks, repeated overheating, excessive vibration, etc.)
   - Cross-reference operational logs (high runtime hours, elevated temperatures, abnormal vibration/pressure)
   - Suggest which equipment should be **prioritized for preventive maintenance** or **upgrades**
4. Create a **C-level presentation** with:
   - Top 3–5 at-risk equipment items
   - Evidence from logs (maintenance + operational data)
   - Recommendations for upgrades, replacements, or new maintenance schedules
5. Deliver findings in a **5-min presentation** to OilLibya leadership

---

## 💡 Suggested Prompts
- “Cluster maintenance records by equipment; rank top 3 equipment with the most issues.”  
- “Using operational data, identify equipment showing abnormal readings (temperature, vibration, pressure).”  
- “Which equipment is most likely to fail soon based on historical records + logs?”  
- “Draft a leadership-ready summary with findings, recommendations, and next steps.”  

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- **Predictive analysis**: list of equipment most likely to fail soon  
- **Recommendations**: preventive actions, upgrades, or replacements  
- **Executive summary**: bullet-point report for OilLibya executives  
- **Presentation slides** (optional): with findings & recommendations  

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Suggest **sensor thresholds** for real-time alerts (temperature, vibration, pressure)  
- Propose **predictive KPIs** (e.g., MTBF – Mean Time Between Failures)  
- Design a **dashboard concept** for monitoring equipment health continuously  

---

## ✅ Expected Learning Outcomes
By completing this exercise, you will:  
- Learn how AI can analyze engineering data for **predictive maintenance**  
- See how operational & maintenance logs combine to inform **reliability engineering**  
- Practice preparing **executive-ready summaries** from technical data  
- Recommend **practical upgrade paths** to minimize failures and optimize uptime
