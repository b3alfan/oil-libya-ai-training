# Exercise 8.6

# 🦺 Safety & Operations Capstone — AI Safety Inspector

## 🎯 Goal
Use an AI assistant to analyze workplace incident logs in order to:
- **Find recurring safety patterns** across stations, depots, and refinery operations  
- **Highlight risk hotspots** (locations, incident types, times)  
- **Recommend safety improvements and preventive measures**  
- **Prepare a presentation** with findings, recommendations, and suggested actions to OilLibya leadership  

This simulates how Safety & Operations staff can leverage AI for better risk management and proactive accident prevention.

## 📂 What’s Included
- `safety_incidents_capstone.log` → 250-line synthetic incident log with varied events, severities, and corrective actions

---

## 📝 Exercise Steps (45–60 min)
1. Open the file: **`safety_incidents_capstone.log`**
2. Paste a portion of the data (or full log in batches) into your AI tool
3. Ask the AI to:
   - Group incidents by **type**, **location**, and **severity**
   - Identify **patterns** (e.g., repeated fire extinguisher issues at Station-02)
   - Suggest **preventive actions** (e.g., monthly extinguisher checks, new PPE policy)
4. Create a **C-level presentation** with:
   - Top findings (3–5 key safety risks)
   - Recommended improvements and preventive measures
   - Suggested next steps for leadership to implement
5. Deliver your findings in a **5-min presentation** style

---

## 💡 Suggested Prompts
- “Cluster these safety incidents by type and location; rank top 5 issues by frequency.”  
- “Which incidents occur most often and what patterns do you see across depots/stations?”  
- “Suggest preventive measures to reduce these incidents.”  
- “Draft a leadership-ready summary with findings, recommendations, and actions in plain English.”  

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- **Pattern analysis**: incidents grouped by type, location, and severity  
- **Recommendations**: preventive measures (training, audits, inspections)  
- **Executive summary**: bullet-point report for OilLibya executives  
- **Presentation slides** (optional): summarizing findings & suggested actions  

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Propose a **new safety inspection checklist** based on findings  
- Suggest **training programs** targeted at the most common violations  
- Design a **dashboard concept** for real-time AI-driven safety monitoring  

---

## ✅ Expected Learning Outcomes
By completing this exercise, you will:  
- Learn how AI can spot **patterns in safety data**  
- See how AI supports proactive **risk management**  
- Practice preparing **executive-ready summaries** from operational logs  
- Recommend **practical safety improvements** to reduce risks at OilLibya
