# 🏢 Final Capstone — AI Dashboard for OilLibya (2026 Vision)
This is not just a demo — it’s the first draft of OilLibya’s **AI Transformation Roadmap**.

## 🎯 Goal
Work together across all departments to design a shared **AI Dashboard for OilLibya**.  
Each department presents their **mini-capstone output** (HR, IT, Finance, Sales, Safety, Engineering) and the group merges results into a single AI assistant dashboard.  

The exercise ends with each team presenting **one slide mockup or a verbal pitch** showing how their AI assistant contributes to OilLibya’s future vision.

## 📂 What’s Included
- `ai_dashboard_template.pptx` (or .png) → Template slide with **6 labeled boxes**:  
  - HR  
  - IT  
  - Finance  
  - Sales  
  - Safety  
  - Engineering  

Use this as the base for your dashboard mockup. Fill each box with your department’s AI outputs.

## 📝 Exercise Steps (60–90 min)
1. **Team Breakout (15–20 min):**  
   - Each department prepares a mini-summary from their Capstone:  
     - HR Bot → policies, hiring recommendations  
     - IT Bot → system anomalies, error clustering  
     - Finance Bot → expenses, anomalies, spending trends  
     - Sales Bot → customer feedback, responses, campaigns  
     - Safety Bot → incident patterns, preventive measures  
     - Engineering Bot → equipment at risk, predictive maintenance  
   
2. **Dashboard Design (20–30 min):**  
   - As a group, place each department’s output into the dashboard template  
   - Decide: What would this **AI assistant dashboard** look like in real life?  
   - Think about **UI/UX**: How would a manager at OilLibya interact with it daily?  

3. **Presentation Prep (15 min):**  
   - Prepare a **1-slide mockup** (or sketch) using the provided template  
   - Each group will present a **5-minute pitch** to the class:  
     - What your AI assistant does  
     - Why it matters  
     - How it connects with other departments  

4. **Delivery (15–20 min):**  
   - Each team presents their section  
   - The final slide or verbal pitch shows **“AI at OilLibya 2026”** — a single, cross-functional vision

## 💡 Suggested Prompts
- “If OilLibya had a single AI dashboard, what data would your department want to see every morning?”  
- “What alerts or recommendations should your AI assistant generate automatically?”  
- “How could your AI bot’s output save time, prevent errors, or support better decisions?”  
- “What integrations would make this real — existing systems, data pipelines, sensors?”  

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- **1-slide dashboard mockup** (template with 6 boxes filled in)  
- **Cross-department presentation** (5 min pitch per group)  
- **C-level vision statement**: What would “AI at OilLibya in 2026” look like?  

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Add **inter-department integrations**: e.g., Safety bot feeds into HR for training needs, Finance bot flags costs linked to Engineering repairs  
- Design a **mobile-first dashboard** version for station managers  
- Propose a **phased roadmap**: pilot → scale → full deployment by 2026  

---

## ✅ Expected Learning Outcomes
By completing this final capstone, you will:  
- Practice **cross-functional collaboration** with other departments  
- Learn how AI solutions combine to form a **cohesive organizational strategy**  
- Think about the **real-world challenges** of deploying AI at OilLibya  
- Present a **forward-looking vision** that connects today’s exercises to tomorrow’s operations  

---

## 🔮 Reflection
At the end, ask yourselves:  
- What would it actually take to make this real at OilLibya?  
- Who would own the dashboard? IT? A cross-functional team?  
- What data challenges would you face? (accuracy, access, integration)  
- What cultural or training shifts would staff need to adopt AI daily?  

This is not just a demo — it’s the first draft of OilLibya’s **AI Transformation Roadmap**.
