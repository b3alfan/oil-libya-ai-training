Visited Adi Guadad station. Fire extinguishers were present but untagged. Some signage (flammable, no smoking) was missing on pump area. Attendant not wearing uniform or gloves. Fuel hose on pump 3 had a leak. Spill kit was complete and visible. Logbook was up to date. No grounding cable visible on tanker during refill. Lighting was sufficient. Need to remind team to check expiry dates on PPE.
