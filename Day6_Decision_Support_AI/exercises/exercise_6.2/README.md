# Exercise 6.2 – Automate Fuel Delivery Schedule from Daily Logs

**Objective:**  
Use AI to turn an unstructured log of delivery requests into a clean, tabular delivery schedule.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file `fuel_delivery_log.txt`
2. Ask AI to:
   - Extract structured data: destination, product, quantity, truck, and time
   - Format it as a daily delivery schedule (in a table or CSV)
   - Detect and flag any inconsistencies or clashes in the schedule

---

## 🎯 Deliverables

- Tabular delivery schedule (markdown table, HTML table, or CSV)
- Optional error report if inconsistencies are found

---

## 💡 Prompt Ideas

- “Convert this delivery log into a table by truck and time”
- “Extract a fuel delivery schedule from this depot note”
- “Detect overlapping deliveries or truck assignment conflicts”
