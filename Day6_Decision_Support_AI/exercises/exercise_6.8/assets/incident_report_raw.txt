On June 18, 2024, at 11:42 AM, a small fire broke out near Pump 2 at our Massawa fuel station due to a faulty hose connection. The fire was quickly contained by staff using extinguishers, and no injuries were reported. Damage was limited to one fuel hose and a melted display casing.
Initial investigation confirms the presence of residual fuel vapors near the faulty hose, combined with static discharge from dry weather, as the ignition source. Pump operations were suspended for 2 hours.

The Safety and Operations team has since replaced the damaged equipment, reinforced hose inspection protocols, and scheduled refresher training for all pump attendants.
