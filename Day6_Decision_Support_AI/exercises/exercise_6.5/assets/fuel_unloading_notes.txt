Talked to Dawit from Ops — we need to always double-check if the grounding cable is attached before unloading fuel. Last week, someone forgot. Big risk. The nozzle sometimes drips after the pump shuts off — maybe add a reminder to keep the drip tray under. Trucks need to be parked with brakes on and wheels locked before connecting the hose. SOP should say the supervisor signs off before pump starts. Also, someone from safety should check for leaks mid-transfer, not just after.
