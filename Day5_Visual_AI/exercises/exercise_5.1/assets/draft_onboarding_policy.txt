Draft Employee Onboarding Policy – TotalGas Eritrea
 This onboarding policy outlines the process by which new employees are introduced to the company. New staff will undergo a 2-day orientation to learn about company culture, policies, and safety standards.  The first day will consist of HR paperwork and signing of employee conduct forms, while the second day will be department-level introduction.  It is expected that supervisors take time to make new hires feel comfortable. Access cards and uniforms will be provided, but delays might occur depending on stock.  All new employees must complete a fire safety session and receive PPE if they work in depots.  Employees must be at their desks on time from Day 3.  Any late arrivals should be reported to HR. If orientation is missed, they must wait for the next batch. We encourage teams to be welcoming but leave technical instruction to managers.
