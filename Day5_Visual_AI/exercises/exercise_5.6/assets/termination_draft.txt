Subject: Termination

Hi,

You’ve been late so many times and we warned you, but you didn’t really change. We also had issues with you arguing with the depot foreman and missing the training. Because of all this, we’ve decided to terminate your contract, effective immediately. Please return your ID card and uniform before leaving.

Regards,  
HR

P.S. You can ask finance about final salary.
