# Exercise 1.8 – Extract Structured Data from Messy Text

**Objective:**  
Learn how to instruct AI to extract specific information from unstructured or messy text — a common use case in admin, customer service, and accounting roles.

---

## 🧠 Background

Often, you receive unformatted emails, handwritten notes, or long WhatsApp messages. AI can help you:
- Extract names, dates, numbers, action items
- Convert disorganized text into usable formats
- Structure messy inputs into tables, lists, or JSON

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`raw_notes.txt`](assets/raw_notes.txt) — a messy collection of internal communication notes.
2. Prompt the AI to:

   > **"Extract all employee names, locations, task types, and due dates from this text. Format the output as a table."**

3. Try refining your prompt to:
   - Group by person or department
   - Highlight overdue items
   - Output as bullet points instead of a table

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- A cleaned-up, structured version of the original text
- Your prompt(s) used
- One version formatted as a table

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask the AI:
> “Which of these items appear to be urgent or delayed?”  
> “Can you flag anything that is incomplete or vague?”

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use prompts like:  
  “Extract the following fields…”  
  “Group similar tasks…”  
  “List all dates and assigned names…”

- Ask AI to format results for Excel or JSON if you want to import them into tools.
