# Exercise 1.7 – Iterate for Better Clarity

**Objective:**  
Learn how to improve an AI response by asking it to rephrase, clarify, or improve the output — this is the core of **iterative prompting**.

---

## 🧠 Background

Your first AI response is rarely the best. By asking follow-up questions or giving feedback to the AI, you can:
- Improve clarity
- Add structure
- Match your preferred tone or format

This skill is key to using AI effectively at work.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`sample_ai_response.txt`](assets/sample_ai_response.txt). It contains a vague response from AI to a workplace question.

2. Ask the AI:

   > “Can you make this more structured and easier to understand for a new employee?”

3. Then ask follow-up prompts such as:
   - “Add bullet points”
   - “Clarify what each point means”
   - “Use simpler terms”

4. Iterate 2–3 times until you feel the message is clear, polished, and professional.

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit a document with:
- The original AI response (from the asset file)
- Your improved version after iterations
- The exact prompts you used to refine it

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Try the same exercise with this prompt:
> “Rewrite the response as a checklist with clear steps.”

---

## 💡 Tips

Use iterative commands like:
- “Be more concise”
- “Add examples”
- “Use a formal tone”

You're not starting over — you're **coaching** the AI to improve.
