# Exercise 1.3 – Change the Tone of a Message

**Objective:**  
Learn how to instruct AI to adjust the **tone** of a message — professional, casual, assertive, friendly, apologetic, etc.

---

## 🧠 Background

AI can take the same content and rewrite it in a different tone. This is useful when:
- Responding to emails or complaints
- Writing marketing messages
- Drafting memos for different audiences

---

## 📝 Task

1. Copy the sample message below (also in the `assets/` folder as `original_message.txt`):

   ---
   **Original Message:**

   > We will not be able to process your order until the invoice is cleared. Kindly settle the outstanding balance immediately to avoid further delay.

2. Ask the AI to:
   - Rephrase it in a **more polite** tone.
   - Then in a **casual** tone.
   - Finally, in a **more assertive** tone.

3. Copy each version and paste into a table or document.

## 🎯 Deliverable

| Tone        | Rewritten Message |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Polite      | ...               |
| Casual      | ...               |
| Assertive   | ...               |

You may format this in Word, PDF, or markdown.
