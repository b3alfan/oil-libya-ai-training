# Exercise 1.1 – Basic Question Prompt

**Objective:**  
Learn how to ask simple, clear questions to an AI assistant and interpret its response.

---

## 🧠 Background

Before we move into advanced prompting, let’s begin with a basic interaction. Just like you would ask a colleague or an intern for help, AI can answer simple questions — if you ask clearly.

This exercise introduces:
- The **input-output loop** (prompt → AI → refine)
- Being **specific vs vague**
- Simple, polite phrasing

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open your preferred AI tool (ChatGPT or any other available assistant).
2. Ask the following question exactly as shown:

   > **"What are the top 3 benefits of AI in the workplace?"**

3. Observe the answer and copy it into a new document or notepad.
4. Then, try to rephrase the question in a simpler and a more complex way:
   - Simple version: *"Why is AI good for work?"*
   - Complex version: *"Explain three distinct productivity advantages of integrating AI tools in a corporate office."*

5. Compare the 3 responses.

## 🎯 Deliverable

Create a table like this and save it as a `.docx`, `.pdf`, or screenshot:

| Prompt Type       | Prompt                                                    | Key Points from AI Response |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Original Prompt   | What are the top 3 benefits of AI in the workplace?       | 1. ..., 2. ..., 3. ...        |
| Simple Rephrase   | Why is AI good for work?                                   | 1. ..., 2. ..., 3. ...        |
| Complex Rephrase  | Explain three distinct productivity advantages...          | 1. ..., 2. ..., 3. ...        |

## 💡 Tips

- Don’t overthink. Think of it like texting a smart friend.
- Try adjusting tone (e.g., add “please” or “summarize briefly”).
- You’re not being graded. Focus on learning how different inputs affect the answer.
