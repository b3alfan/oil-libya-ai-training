# Exercise 1.2
# Exercise 1.2 – Format a Response as a Table

**Objective:**  
Learn how to ask AI to structure its response as a **table**, which is useful when organizing information clearly — especially for business reports or comparisons.

---

## 🧠 Background

AI can present data in different formats — text, bullet points, or tables. Mastering how to request tabular output makes your results easier to scan, share, or paste into Excel.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open your AI assistant (ChatGPT or similar).
2. Ask the following prompt:

   > **"List 5 departments in a company, their core responsibilities, and common software tools they use. Format the answer as a table."**

3. Copy the AI's response into a new document or note.
4. Try adjusting your prompt to:
   - Request more detail per column
   - Add a new column (e.g., “Key Metrics Tracked”)

## 🎯 Deliverable

Ensure your table looks something like this:

| Department     | Core Responsibility              | Common Tools         |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| HR             | Recruitment, training            | Workday, BambooHR    |
| Finance        | Budgeting, forecasting           | Excel, SAP           |
| ...            | ...                              | ...                  |

Save your output or screenshot it.

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Try this additional prompt:

> **"Compare procurement and sales departments in terms of their goals, workflows, and common documents used. Format as a table."**

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use phrases like “format as table”, “three columns”, or “summarize in tabular form”
- If the table is too long, try: “Give me just 3 rows” or “Summarize briefly”
