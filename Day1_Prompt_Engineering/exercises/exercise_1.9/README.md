# Exercise 1.9 – Take-Home Challenge: Automate a Tedious Task in Your Role

**Objective:**  
Apply everything you've learned about prompting to identify a real task from your job that could be partially or fully assisted by AI.

This is your first real-world application challenge.

---

## 🧠 Background

Every job has repetitive tasks — drafting emails, compiling lists, writing memos, summarizing reports, replying to customers, converting formats, and so on.

AI can help reduce that load — but only if you craft the right prompts.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Think of a task in your current job that:
   - Takes you a lot of time
   - Feels repetitive or boring
   - You wish someone else could help with

2. Write **10 prompts** that would help an AI assistant perform that task with you.

   - At least 3 prompts should focus on data handling
   - At least 2 prompts should involve writing or replying
   - At least 1 prompt should be exploratory: “What is the best way to…”

3. For each prompt:
   - Try it in ChatGPT or another tool
   - Save the result
   - Modify the prompt to improve it

## 📄 Deliverable

Submit a short document (Word, PDF, or Markdown) containing:

- Your job title
- The task you chose
- Your 10 prompts
- 3 sample AI outputs (with before/after prompt improvements)
- A final summary: **"How much time do you think this would save you weekly?"**

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Build a “Prompt Template”:
