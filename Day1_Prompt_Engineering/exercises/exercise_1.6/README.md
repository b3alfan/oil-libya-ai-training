# Exercise 1.6 – Translate and Rephrase

**Objective:**  
Use AI to translate text between languages and rephrase it for different audiences — a common need in multinational or multilingual teams.

---

## 🧠 Background

AI can help translate and **localize** messages into:
- Other languages
- Simpler wording
- Formal or informal tone

This is especially helpful when working across departments, customer regions, or management levels.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`original_email.txt`](assets/original_email.txt). It contains a basic customer service message written in English.

2. Ask the AI to:
   - Translate it into **Arabic**.
   - Rephrase the original English into:
     - A more **formal version**
     - A **simplified version** for customers with low literacy

3. Optionally: Translate the message into **French** or **Tigrinya** if you're comfortable.

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- Arabic translation
- Rephrased formal English version
- Rephrased simplified English version
- (Optional) Other language version

Include your exact prompt(s) used and any follow-up adjustments.

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask the AI:
> “How would you write this if it were going to a government ministry?”  
> “Now rewrite for a delivery driver with limited English.”

Compare tone, complexity, and structure.

## 💡 Tips

Use prompts like:
- “Translate into Arabic and keep the meaning accurate”
- “Make this message easier for someone with a 5th-grade reading level”
- “Rewrite for a formal audience”
