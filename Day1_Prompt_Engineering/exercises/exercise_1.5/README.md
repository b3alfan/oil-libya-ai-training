# Exercise 1.5

# Exercise 1.5 – Role-Based Prompting (Act as...)

**Objective:**  
Learn how to make the AI behave like a specific role — such as a procurement officer, HR manager, or safety consultant — to simulate realistic, job-relevant outputs.

---

## 🧠 Background

AI tools can “act” as specific personas if guided properly. This helps you simulate tasks or generate content as if written by someone with that job.

Example:
> “Act as a procurement supervisor. Write a memo requesting updated supplier pricing for Q4.”

---

## 📝 Task

1. Choose **one role** from the following list:
   - Procurement Supervisor
   - Customer Service Representative
   - Sales Manager
   - HR and GS Manager
   - Safety Officer
   - Accountant

2. Open the file [`task_list.txt`](assets/task_list.txt). Pick **one task** related to your chosen role.

3. Prompt the AI to complete the task **as if it were that role**.
   Example prompt:
   > “Act as an HR Manager. Write a short policy update memo about leave applications based on the points below.”

4. Try different phrasings like:
   - “Write like a professional in this role…”
   - “Use the tone and language of a [job title]…”

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit a 150–300 word output generated by the AI for your selected role and task. Indicate:
- Your chosen role
- The original task prompt
- The final AI-generated content

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask the AI:
> “How would a junior vs senior [role] write this differently?”

Compare tone, detail, and structure.

---

## 💡 Tips

Use “Act as…” or “Write from the point of view of…” to shape the voice of your AI output.
