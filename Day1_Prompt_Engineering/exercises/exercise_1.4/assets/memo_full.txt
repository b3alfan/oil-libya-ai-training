To: All Department Heads
Subject: Operations & Logistics Memo â€“ Q3

This quarter, several delays in delivery were observed across our regional depots due to inventory mismatches and late supplier payments. In response, Procurement will be transitioning to a new automated invoice system starting next month.

The Operations team will be revising its delivery schedules, and all department heads are requested to submit updated inventory needs by the 10th of next month. Failure to do so may result in shortages and budgeting conflicts.

Additionally, we remind everyone that safety protocol audits will begin on the 20th and continue through the end of the quarter. Each team must ensure their logs and documentation are ready for review.

Finally, a leadership workshop will be hosted in mid-October to improve cross-department collaboration. Attendance is mandatory for all mid-level managers.

Thank you for your cooperation.
