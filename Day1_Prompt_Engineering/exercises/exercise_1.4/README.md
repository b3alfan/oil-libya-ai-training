# Exercise 1.4
# Exercise 1.4 – Summarize a Memo

**Objective:**  
Learn how to ask AI to summarize long text into a short, clear, and useful version — ideal for reporting, briefing, or executive updates.

---

## 🧠 Background

Professionals often need to review long memos or reports. AI can summarize these into:
- Executive summaries
- Actionable takeaways
- Bullet point highlights

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`memo_full.txt`](assets/memo_full.txt) in the `assets/` folder.
2. Read through the memo — it’s about an internal operations update.
3. Ask your AI assistant:

   > **"Summarize the following internal memo into 5 bullet points. Keep it concise and clear."**

4. Try rephrasing your prompt to:
   - Focus on **action items only**
   - Ask for a **1-paragraph summary**
   - Get a **summary for senior management**

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- A 5-bullet point version of the memo
- A 1-paragraph summary
- An “executive version” (if different)

Paste into a Word document or Markdown table.

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Try summarizing the same memo using this prompt:

> **"What are the risks and recommended actions mentioned in this memo?"**

---

## 💡 Tips

Use follow-up prompts:
- “Make it shorter”
- “Summarize with focus on logistics”
- “Translate to layman’s terms”
