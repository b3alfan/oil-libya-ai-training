whom it may concern,

I am extremely disappointed with your service. I placed an urgent fuel order for our station in Barentu FIVE days ago and have yet to receive even a confirmation, let alone the delivery. Your hotline doesn't answer, and nobody has responded to my emails.

We’re now facing operational downtime because of your delay. This is completely unacceptable. If I don’t hear back by tomorrow morning, we will escalate this to the regulatory board and reconsider doing business with TotalGas Eritrea.
