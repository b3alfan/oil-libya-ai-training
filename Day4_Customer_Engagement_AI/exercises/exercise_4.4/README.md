# Exercise 4.4 – Rewrite Marketing Content for Different Audiences

**Objective:**  
Use AI to rewrite the same piece of promotional or service-related text for different audiences — including customers, partners, and internal teams.

---

## 🧠 Background

Marketing and service teams often need to adapt the same message into:
- A social media post
- A formal partner letter
- A WhatsApp message
- A staff bulletin

AI can help you adjust tone, length, and format instantly.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`original_announcement.txt`](assets/original_announcement.txt). It contains a single marketing message announcing a new premium-grade diesel product.
2. Ask AI to rewrite this message for:
   - A WhatsApp message to long-time customers
   - A formal letter to B2B partners
   - A Facebook post for general public
   - An internal announcement for depot staff

3. Try variations:
   - “Make it sound friendly and personal”
   - “Write in formal business tone”
   - “Shorten this for a caption or flyer”

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

- 4 rewrites for 4 audiences
- Notes on which prompt you used for each
- Any refinements made

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask AI:
> “Now translate each version into Arabic or Tigrinya.”

Then compare how tone and structure are preserved in translation.

---

## 💡 Tips

Prompt examples:
- “Rewrite for social media, 280 characters max”
- “Make this casual but respectful for WhatsApp”
- “Turn into a short memo for depot staff”
