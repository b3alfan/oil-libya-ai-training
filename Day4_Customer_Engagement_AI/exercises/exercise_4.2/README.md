# Exercise 4.2

# Exercise 4.2 – Detect Intent from Customer Messages

**Objective:**  
Use AI to analyze incoming customer messages and determine their **intent**, **emotion**, and **urgency** — critical for routing support requests and prioritizing response.

---

## 🧠 Background

Customer service teams need to know:
- What the customer is trying to achieve (intent)
- How they feel (emotion)
- How quickly they need help (urgency)

AI can interpret this quickly and label messages, helping automate triage.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`customer_messages.txt`](assets/customer_messages.txt). It contains 7 different messages received from customers via email, chat, and WhatsApp.
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Analyze each message. Label the customer’s intent, emotional tone, and urgency level (Low, Medium, High)."**

3. Then prompt:
   - “Return a table with: Message ID, Intent, Emotion, Urgency”
   - “Suggest routing priority: Finance, Sales, Support, or Escalation”

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

- A labeled table of all 7 messages
- Optional routing suggestions
- Your prompt(s) used and any refinement

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask:
> “Write a one-line auto-response for each message acknowledging receipt and setting expectation.”

---

## 💡 Tips

Use phrasing like:
- “Detect urgency and sentiment”
- “Classify each message by intent: complaint, request, feedback, etc.”
- “Suggest best team to handle each one”
