# Exercise 4.7 – Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback

**Objective:**  
Use AI to classify and respond to different types of customer sentiment.

---

## 🧠 Background

Companies receive customer messages through many channels — WhatsApp, calls, emails, and more. Some are positive, others are complaints. AI can help you:
- Identify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
- Recommend response tone and urgency
- Suggest who should follow up

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`customer_feedback.csv`](assets/customer_feedback.csv)
2. For each message, ask AI to:
   - Classify it as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**
   - Recommend a response tone (e.g. “Apologetic and formal” or “Friendly and informative”)
   - Suggest who should respond (e.g. Sales Rep, Depot Manager, Customer Service)

3. Bonus:
   - Try rephrasing each as a support ticket entry or log
   - Ask AI to prioritize them by urgency

## 🎯 Deliverable

- Table or notes with sentiment, response tone, urgency
- Prompts used to classify or rephrase messages

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask:
> “Which messages require same-day response and which can wait?”

---

## 💡 Tips

Prompt ideas:
- “Classify each message’s sentiment and assign response tone”
