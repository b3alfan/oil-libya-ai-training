# Exercise 4.3 – Generate a Chatbot Flow

**Objective:**  
Use AI to help design a basic chatbot flow for customer service — useful for creating automated responses via WhatsApp, web chat, or IVR.

---

## 🧠 Background

Chatbots improve service by guiding customers through common tasks like:
- Tracking deliveries
- Submitting complaints
- Requesting documents or quotes

AI can help design the conversation steps and simulate responses.

2. Read the sample chatbot goals provided.
3. Ask the AI:

   > **"Create a simple chatbot flow for diesel delivery tracking. Include greeting, user options, and follow-up steps."**

4. Then try:
   - “Turn this into a WhatsApp-ready script”
   - “Add fallback responses if customer types something unexpected”
   - “Write the chatbot flow in decision tree format (bullets or arrows)”
