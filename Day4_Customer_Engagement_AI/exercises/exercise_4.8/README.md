## 🧠 Background

Marketing data often contains missing values or anomalies. AI tools can:
- Spot missing metrics (like engagement or conversions)
- Suggest clean-up or correction
- Recommend what’s working or not across channels

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`marketing_campaign_log.csv`](assets/marketing_campaign_log.csv)
2. Ask the AI:
   - Which fields are missing or inconsistent?
   - What insights can we draw from successful campaigns?
   - Which channel underperformed?
   - How could tracking improve for unmeasured campaigns?

3. Ask it to generate a brief report summarizing campaign performance.
