# Exercise 4.6

# Exercise 4.6 – Create a Promotional Post for Different Platforms

**Objective:**  
Use AI to generate platform-specific promotional content from a single core idea — useful for sales, marketing, and public relations.

---

## 🧠 Background

Each platform has a unique tone and length:
- **Instagram** favors visuals and short captions
- **Facebook** prefers friendly tone and medium-length text
- **LinkedIn** works best with a professional, benefit-driven style
- **Twitter/X** is short, punchy, and tag-friendly

AI can help tailor one message to multiple formats with minimal effort.

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`core_promo_idea.txt`](assets/core_promo_idea.txt) — it contains a short brief about a limited-time fuel loyalty promotion.
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Turn this into a post for Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Keep tone and formatting appropriate for each platform."**

3. Then try:
   - “Make the LinkedIn version more technical and benefit-focused”
   - “Add 3 hashtags for each version”
   - “Shorten for WhatsApp broadcast message”
