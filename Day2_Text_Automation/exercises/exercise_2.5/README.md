# Exercise 2.5 – Translate Workplace Memos

**Objective:**  
Use AI to translate a workplace memo into multiple languages for cross-functional communication — useful for HR, operations, and regional coordination.

---

## 🧠 Background

AI can help localize communications, especially in companies with multilingual staff. Translations should:
- Retain meaning and tone
- Respect formal language conventions
- Be accessible to different audiences

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`training_memo.txt`](assets/training_memo.txt) — it’s a short HR memo about an upcoming safety training session.
2. Ask the AI to translate the memo into:
   - **Arabic**
   - **Tigrinya**
   - **French**
3. Ask the AI to ensure the tone remains formal and respectful.

4. Optionally:
   - Request a **simplified English version** for workers with limited literacy
   - Ask for a **poster-style version** for WhatsApp or bulletin boards

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- The translated memos (all 3 languages)
- A simplified English version (optional)
- Your prompt(s) used for each

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask the AI:
> “How would this message be phrased differently for field workers vs office managers?”

Write both versions in the same language (your choice).

---

## 💡 Tips

Use prompts like:
- “Translate to Arabic using formal business tone”
- “Simplify this for workers in the field”
- “Make it suitable for posting as a WhatsApp image caption”
