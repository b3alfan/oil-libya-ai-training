# Exercise 2.8

# Exercise 2.8 – Draft Interview Questions from a CV

**Objective:**  
Use AI to generate tailored interview questions by analyzing a candidate’s resume — useful for HR, team leads, and hiring managers.

---

## 🧠 Background

Instead of generic interview questions, you can use AI to read a CV and create:
- Role-specific questions
- Questions targeting experience or gaps
- Behavioral or technical prompts

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`candidate_cv.txt`](assets/candidate_cv.txt) — a sample CV for a logistics coordinator.
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Based on this resume, generate 5 interview questions to evaluate the candidate’s skills and fit for a logistics supervisor role."**

3. Then try these variations:
   - Ask for 3 behavioral questions (e.g., teamwork, problem-solving)
   - Ask for 2 technical questions related to logistics systems

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit:
- 10 total questions generated (5 general, 3 behavioral, 2 technical)
- A brief explanation of your prompt(s) used

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask:
> “What possible red flags or gaps might a hiring manager want to explore in this CV?”

Note the AI's suggestions.

---

## 💡 Tips

Use prompt refinements like:
- “Focus on time management, communication, and software use”
- “Make questions open-ended, not yes/no”
