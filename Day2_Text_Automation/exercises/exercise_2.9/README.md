# Exercise 2.9 – Take-Home Challenge: Automate a Document Review Task

**Objective:**  
Apply your skills from today to create an AI workflow that reviews, summarizes, or categorizes documents relevant to your actual job.

---

## 🧠 Background

Most office roles involve reviewing documents — emails, policies, complaints, reports. AI can automate the most time-consuming parts:
- Reading and flagging key points
- Summarizing long content
- Detecting urgency, tone, or category
- Drafting responses or follow-ups

---

## 📝 Task

1. Identify one type of document you **personally handle regularly**. This might be:
   - Monthly sales summaries
   - Customer complaints
   - HR forms or memos
   - Safety logs
   - Technical reports

2. Collect or copy 1–2 real or sample documents.

3. Using AI, perform the following:
   - **Summarize** the document in bullet points
   - **Extract key fields** (names, dates, amounts, deadlines)
   - **Label the document type**
   - **Draft a response or action note**

4. Test different prompts to get the best results.

## 🎯 Deliverable

Submit a short report (Word, PDF, or Markdown) containing:
- The document(s) you tested (or redacted samples)
- Your prompt(s)
- Screenshots or copy-pasted AI outputs
- Final reflections:
  - What worked best?
  - How would this help you in your daily job?

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Try building a **prompt template** for reuse, like:

> *“Summarize this [document type] in 5 bullet points. Then extract names, dates, and decisions. Format as table.”*

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use sample documents if needed (you can copy from today’s assets)
- Don’t worry about formatting — focus on learning the workflow

---

## 📁 Assets

Use any document you normally interact with, or reuse content from:
- `exercise_2.1` (complaints)
- `exercise_2.7` (monthly reports)
- `exercise_2.6` (scanned documents)
