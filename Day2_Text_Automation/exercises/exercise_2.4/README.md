# Exercise 2.4 – Write Standard Responses Using AI

**Objective:**  
Use AI to draft clear and consistent responses to common workplace situations — ideal for customer service, admin, and HR teams.

---

## 🧠 Background

Responding to similar messages repeatedly wastes time. With well-crafted prompts, AI can help you generate:
- Polite replies
- Clarifications
- Apology notes
- Confirmations

These can be saved as templates or used as starting points.

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`inbox_messages.txt`](assets/inbox_messages.txt) — it contains 5 short customer or internal queries.
2. For each one, ask the AI:

   > **"Write a professional and helpful response to this message."**

3. Make sure your responses:
   - Acknowledge the issue or question
   - Provide a clear and helpful reply
   - Maintain a polite, professional tone

## 🎯 Deliverable

- A document containing:
  - The original message
  - Your AI-generated reply
- Indicate any prompt tweaks you made (e.g., "Make it more concise")

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask the AI to:
> “Turn each response into a reusable template I can use again.”

Example result:
> "Dear [Name], Thank you for your message regarding [Issue]. We are currently reviewing..."
