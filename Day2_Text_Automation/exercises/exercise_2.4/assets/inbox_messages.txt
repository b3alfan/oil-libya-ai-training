1. Can you send me a copy of the signed fuel delivery form from last week?

2. Our invoice shows an extra charge that we don’t understand — please clarify.

3. Bilal, just confirming if the AI training is still on for Monday?

4. I submitted the expense form but didn’t receive a confirmation yet.

5. There’s a spelling mistake in the contract you sent us — our depot name is "Massawa" not "Masawa".
