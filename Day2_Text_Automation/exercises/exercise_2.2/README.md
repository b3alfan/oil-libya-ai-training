# Exercise 2.2

# Exercise 2.2 – Auto-Categorize Documents by Type

**Objective:**  
Train the AI to label or classify multiple documents based on their content — an essential task for HR, procurement, and administrative departments.

---

## 🧠 Background

AI can be asked to **automatically identify the type of document** — invoice, memo, contract, receipt, etc. This reduces time spent on manual sorting and allows for faster search or archiving.

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`mixed_documents.txt`](assets/mixed_documents.txt). It contains snippets from different types of workplace documents.
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Read the following items and classify each one as either a: Memo, Invoice, Policy, Report, Receipt, or Email."**

3. Ask the AI to return:
   - A list with each document and its **assigned label**
   - A table with columns: Excerpt | Type | Confidence (guess)

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

- A list or table classifying all the entries
- One screenshot or file showing the AI response
- The prompt you used (and any follow-ups)

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask the AI:
> “Can you sort these into folders based on their type and tell me how many belong to each category?”

---

## 💡 Tips

You can use phrasing like:
- “Label each document”
- “Return a confidence score”
- “Sort and count by category”

---

## 📁 Assets

- [`mixed_documents.txt`](assets/mixed_documents.txt) — Document excerpts to classify
