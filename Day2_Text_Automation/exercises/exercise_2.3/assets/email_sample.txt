1. I’ve emailed your office twice already and still haven’t received my payment receipt.

2. Just wanted to thank your team for resolving the delivery issue so quickly!

3. What’s going on with my last order? This is the third delay in a row and I haven’t heard anything.

4. Kindly let us know if we need to submit the forms again — we’re happy to do so.

5. This is unacceptable. I demand an immediate explanation for the overcharge!
