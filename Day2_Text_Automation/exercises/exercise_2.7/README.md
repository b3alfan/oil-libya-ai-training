# Exercise 2.7 – Generate Bullet Point Summaries from Reports

**Objective:**  
Use AI to convert a long report into a clean, concise bullet list — ideal for management updates, presentations, or internal communication.

---

## 🧠 Background

Not everyone has time to read full reports. Bullet point summaries make key information easier to digest. AI can:
- Pull out the most important facts
- Organize them clearly
- Reduce clutter

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`monthly_report.txt`](assets/monthly_report.txt). It contains a standard operations report.
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Summarize this report into 6–8 bullet points. Focus on facts, figures, and recommendations."**

3. Then ask:
   - “Make it suitable for presentation slides”
   - “Add bold emphasis for key numbers or actions”

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

- 6–8 bullets summarizing the report
- A cleaned-up version suitable for PowerPoint
- Your exact prompt(s)

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Ask:
> “Can you rephrase this for an executive update email?”

Then compare the tone and word choice.

---

## 💡 Tips

Use phrasing like:
- “Extract action points”
- “Focus on recommendations”
- “Use clear bullets with 1–2 lines each”
