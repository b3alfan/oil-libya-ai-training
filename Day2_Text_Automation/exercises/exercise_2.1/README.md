# Exercise 2.1 – Summarize Customer Complaints

**Objective:**  
Use AI to read multiple customer complaints and summarize their common themes, sentiment, and urgency — a vital skill in customer service, sales, and management reporting.

---

## 🧠 Background

Organizations often receive complaint messages in various formats: email, handwritten notes, online forms. Manually summarizing them takes time. AI can help:
- Detect tone/sentiment
- Identify repeated issues
- Suggest priority items

---

## 📝 Task

1. Open the file [`customer_complaints.txt`](assets/customer_complaints.txt).
2. Ask the AI:

   > **"Summarize these complaints into 3–5 key themes. Identify any urgent issues and note repeated patterns."**

3. Then ask for:
   - A **bullet point summary**
   - A **summary table** with columns: Complaint Type | Frequency | Example | Urgency

---

## 🎯 Deliverable

- List of top 3–5 complaint themes
- A simple summary table (optional)
- 2–3 example AI prompts you used

---

## 🔁 Bonus Task

Try this prompt:
> “Draft a short report to the Sales and Customer Service Manager summarizing these complaints and recommending next steps.”

Save your AI output as a 1-paragraph report.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use terms like:
  - “Group similar issues”
  - “Focus on tone and urgency”
  - “Identify pain points”
- You can use follow-ups like: “Give me a table instead”
