1. I ordered fuel for my station on Monday and still haven’t received it — no update from your team either.
2. The driver was rude when delivering last week. He refused to help connect the pipe properly.
3. We received the wrong quantity again. This keeps happening.
4. Customer support lines are constantly busy. I waited 30 minutes yesterday.
5. Price was changed last minute after confirmation — very frustrating!
6. No receipt was sent after payment. This is the second time it’s happened.
7. I was promised a callback and never got one. This is unprofessional.
